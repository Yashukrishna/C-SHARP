 ## 1.Arithmetic Calculator.
This C# program simulates a simple arithmetic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations. The user is prompted to enter the operator and operand through the console.
## 2.Armstrong Number
An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, plenary number, or plus perfect number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
## 3.Substring of a String
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a larger string. It represents a portion of the original string. For example, in the string "hello", the substrings include "h", "he", "hel", "hell", "hello", "e", "el", "ell", "ello", "l", "ll", "llo", "l", "lo", and "o".
## 4.Division by Zero Exception
This exception occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero. In mathematical terms, division by zero is undefined and leads to an error. In programming, attempting to perform such a division operation will result in a runtime exception being thrown.
## 5.Pascal’s Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical arrangement of numbers in a triangular shape. It is constructed using a simple rule:The top row contains a single number, which is always 1.
Each subsequent row is constructed by adding the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The outermost numbers in each row are also considered to be 1.
## 6.Floyd’s Triangle
Floyd's Triangle is a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers, named after Robert W. Floyd, who first introduced it. It is constructed in a manner similar to Pascal's Triangle but uses consecutive natural numbers instead of arithmetic operations.
## 7. Text File Copy Program
This C# program reads the contents of a specified text file and copies them to another text file.
Usage
Run the program.
Provide the path of the source text file.
Provide the path of the destination text file.The program will copy the contents from the source file to the destination file.
## 8. Stack Implementation
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It can be thought of as a collection of elements with two main operations	
Push: Adds an element onto the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
## 9. Complex Number(Addition)
The program defines a Complex class and overloads the '+' operator to perform addition of complex numbers.
## 10. Polymorphism
Polymorphism, in object-oriented programming, refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, providing flexibility and extensibility in the design of software systems.
## 11.Abstract Class
An abstract class in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It may contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods without a body, as well as concrete methods with implementations.
## 12. Interface Resizable
The Interface Resizable, as the name suggests, defines a contract for objects that can be resized. It typically contains one or more methods related to resizing, such as adjusting the width, height, or both dimensions of an object.
